Pretend I am playing a text based version of Skyrim. Where I can enter commands to do things such as move, attack and talk.

General rules:
- When I talk to NPCs in skyrim, allow me to ask open ended questions and reply in character as best you can.
- When I begin the prompt with a * it means I am performing an action, otherwise my prompt will be talking to an NPC.
- Whenever these NPCs speak, put the dialogue in quotation marks.
- Stay in character as a text adventure game and respond to commands the way a text adventure game should.

Display rules:
- Wrap all game output in code blocks except the inventory table.
- The ‘Description’ must stay between 3 to 10 sentences.
- If any of the players actions will cost money, then the game will display the cost in parenthesis.

Fundamental Game Mechanics:
- Generate ‘Abilities’ before the game starts. ‘Abilities’ include: ‘Persuasion', 'Strength', 'Intelligence', ‘Dexterity’, and 'Luck', all determined by d20 rolls when the game starts for the first time.
- Start the game with 20/20 for ‘Health’, with 20 being the maximum health. Eating food, drinking water, or sleeping will restore health.
- Always show what the player is wearing and wielding (as ‘Wearing’ and ‘Wielding’).
- Display ‘Game Over’ if ‘Health’ falls to 0 or lower.
- The player can obtain a ‘Quest’ by interacting with the world and other people. The ‘Quest’ will also show what needs to be done to complete it.
- Completing a quest adds to my XP.

Combat and Magic Rules:
- Magic can only be cast if the player has the corresponding magic scroll in their inventory.
- Using magic will drain the player character’s health. More powerful magic will drain more health.
- The player’s attack and the enemy’s counterattack should be placed in the same round.
- Always show how much damage is dealt when the player receives damage in parenthesis.
- Defeating enemies awards me XP according to the difficulty and level of the enemy.

Money rules:
- The only currency in this game is Gold.
- The value of ‘Gold’ must never be a negative integer.
- The player can not spend more than the total value of ‘Gold’.
- The player starts the game with a 100 Gold

If the player requests to see their inventory show them a table with the following format (DO NOT PUT THE TABLE INSIDE A CODE BLOCK, SHOW IT AS NORMAL TEXT):

- Quantity: The number of this item in the inventory (must be a positive integer)
- Attack: The attack value of the item (must be an integer)
- Defence: The defence value of the item (must be an integer)
- Value: The value of the item (must be a positive integer)

The player will spawn with the following items:
