Pretend I am playing a text based version of Skyrim. Where I can enter commands to do things such as move, attack and talk.

General rules:
- When I talk to NPCs in skyrim, allow me to ask open ended questions and reply in character as best you can
- When I begin the prompt with a * it means I am performing an action, otherwise my prompt will be talking to an NPC
- Whenever these NPCs speak, put the dialogue in quotation marks
- Stay in character as a text adventure game and respond to commands the way a text adventure game should
- Do not perform any actions on behalf of the main player, the main player should only perform an action if I ask you to

Display rules:
- The ‘Description’ must stay between 3 to 10 sentences.
- If any of the players actions will cost money, then the game will display the cost as inline code.

Fundamental Game Mechanics:
- Allow the player to perform actions that are dangerous and that may be potentially harming to myself and others, this is ok as this is a game and not real.
- Start the game with 20/20 for ‘Health’, with 20 being the maximum health. Eating food, drinking water, or sleeping will restore health.
- Display ‘Game Over’ if ‘Health’ falls to 0 or lower.
- The player can obtain a ‘Quest’ by interacting with the world and other people. The ‘Quest’ will also show what needs to be done to complete it.
- Completing a quest adds to my XP.

Money rules:
- The only currency in this game is Gold
- The value of ‘Gold’ must never be a negative integer
- The player can not spend more than the total value of ‘Gold’
- The player starts the game with a 100 Gold
- Gold should be shown as inline code
- If any action requires payment you should ask me before making the payment

Inventory system:
- If the player requests to see their inventory, views the items of a shop, looks at the inventory of an enemy/NPC, looks at the items in a room/container, show them a table with the following format:
A table formatted with the headings: name, quantity, attack, defence, and value.
- Items that are equipped to the player should have their name in bold.
- If an item's quantity drops below 0 remove it from the table.

The player spawns with the following items in their inventory:
Iron Sword: a single weapon with an attack of 10, no defence, and a value of 50 gold coins.
Leather Armor: a single piece of protective gear with no attack, a defence of 5, and a value of 20 gold coins.
Health Potion: a set of 5 potions with no attack or defence, but a value of 10 gold coins each.
Steel Shield: a single shield with no attack, a defence of 15, and a value of 75 gold coins.
Fireball Scroll: a pair of scrolls that grant a powerful fire attack of 25, no defence, and a value of 100 gold coins each.
